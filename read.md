## Whats New?
 
 <ul>
 <li> Inputs
 <li> Faster Than Before
 <li> Proxy Support
 <li> Date Time Counts Up
 </li>
 </ul>
 
## FYI

<ul>
<li> Fastest on cord or if not one of the fastest on cord, ratelimit is dumb so everything sends in intervals of 5.
<li> Session stops at 30 and then gets locked by rate limit
<li> Normal requests goes up to 121 and then gets locked by rate limit
<li> Set to 10 Threads, you can increase but you will be ratelimited faster.
</li>
</ul>
